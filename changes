Testing git

04/29 03 Eudora2Mbox.py
	Improved attachment code so that if the attachment appeared
	neither to be a Mac path or a DOS path, it prints and saves
	an error message.

	Eudora2Mbox.py
	Made to replace slash characters in descmap.pce file with 
	Unix-friendly underscore.

	index.html
	Made clearer who the maintainer is, and what the purpose of
	the SourceForge site is.

03/06 02 *.py
	Made to abort if Python version is less than 2.2.1.
	Started a separate branch that is back-ported to 1.5.2.
	Reason is that the back-port makes a lot of the code much
	uglier than the 2.2.1 version.

	*.html
	Reflected these changes, tidied up, and inserted a section
	in details.html about how incoming and outgoing messages ought
	to be handled.

12/12 02 Eudora2Mbox.py
	Made to reconstruct header Date: with comma after weekday
	see RFC 2822 3.3 (Balsa chokes on this)
	Fixes all Eudora message dates (but not non-Eudora messages)

	Was stripping whitespace off beginnings of all lines,
	including 'wrapped' header lines.  Fixed this.

	Made to correctly run stand-alone.

	Made to process all messages rather than just Eudora messages,
	so that header formatting can be standardized, and
	TOC and In-Reply-To info can be handled.

03/06 02 *.py
	Made to abort if Python version is less than 2.2.1.
