See

for a discussion of the horror that is Eudora's long filename mangling on Mac OS X.

If you see missing attachments with filenames like this:

FAILED to find attachment: 'Baidarka HD:IRD Projec REVIEWS sc#D8D4B.xls'

that means that Eudora on the Mac at some point synthesized a
shortened file name.  In this case, #D8D4B is the Inode number for the
file on disk.

Which is completely useless if you've moved the Eudora folder from one
system to another.
