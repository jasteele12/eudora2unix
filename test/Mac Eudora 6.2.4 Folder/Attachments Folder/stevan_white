I have a couple of Mac OS X systems at home that I'll get sometest boxes set up in tonight.  At work I use Linux, but I have accessto a Windows Vista system I can use to generate some mailboxes.| > Here is what I have it supporting now, though:| >| > Re-connection of attachments with MIME| >| > Limited re-connection of embedded images for HTML emails that use| > cid: URIs in tags to reference Embedded images.

Especially with, you know, a test suite. ;-)Speaking of test suite, do you have a Python unit testing frameworkthat you like?  I've created my own test framework in Java for oneproduct, and I'm familiar with JUnit, but I don't know what the go-toframework is in Python.| > | Does your new version still support mbox and KMail?| >| > No, right now I just made it use the Python mailbox class to generate| > mbox style mailboxes.| >| > The mailbox formats supported by the mailbox module in the Python| > version I have are:| >| > Maildir| > mbox| > MMDF mailbox| > MH mailbox| > An Rmail-style Babyl mailbox|=20| OK.  Well, I'm not sure what to do about that.
