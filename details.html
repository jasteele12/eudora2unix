<h1>Eudora2Unix Details</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
	Converts Eudora mailbox files to mbox format
</li>
<li>
	Can use Eudora '<kbd>.toc</kbd>' files to preserve info of whether a
	message was read or not, and the message priority.
</li>
<li>
	Marks a file as "Answered" for Pine if it find another message
	that refers to it.
</li>
<li>
	For Windows directories, can use '<kbd>dscmap.pce</kbd>' files to
	restore folder and file names.
</li>
<li>
	Converts Eudora directory structure to either Pine or Kmail format
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Tested on
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
	Eudora v 5 Windows
</li>
<li>
	Eudora Lite v 3.1.3 Mac
</li>
<li>
	Eudora Lite v 1.3.1 Mac
</li>
<li>
	Eudora Lite v 3.0.6 Windows
</li>
<li>
	Eudora Lite v 1.5.4 Windows
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Mailbox format
</h2>
<p>
The Eudora mailbox format is very nearly unix mbox format, the main
difference being that the initial line of a message, the one
that begins with the word '<code>From </code>' with no colon, has the string
'<code>???@???</code>' in place of the sender's e-mail.  By extracting the
sender's e-mail from other message headers and using this to repair the
'<code>From </code>' line, Eudora mailboxes are made usable by many unix
mail clients.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Date</code> header is often left off of Eudora messages,
presumably because it is contained in the initial '<code>From </code>' line. 
That date isn't in quite the format required by mbox format, so it must be
massaged a little. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the exact format of the date header specified in
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</a>
is not always achieved by old email.  Often, the comma required after the
weekday is left off; this will choke some finicky clients.  This is also
repaired.
</p>

<h2>
Status and priority
</h2>
<p>
Most clients have a mechanism for indicating
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Whether or not a message has been read
</li>
<li>
	Whether or not a message has been downloaded
</li>
<li>
	A level of priority of a message
</li>
<li>
	Whether a message was answered, re-directed, or forwarded
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This info isn't very well standardized.  
</p>

<p>
Most versions of Eudora for Windows and Mac keep this info for each
mailbox in a separate binary file with the suffix '<kbd>.toc</kbd>'. 
The exact format of this file varies between versions and is the subject
of some debate.  Furthermore, some Mac versions of Eudora store the info
in the Mac "resorce fork" of the mailbox file.  Fortunately, Qualcomm
has provided utilities for converting such mailboxes to the two-file
version.  Get it here:
<a href="ftp://ftp.eudora.com/eudora/eudoralight/mac/extras/utils/TOCConvert.sea.hqx">TOCConvert</a>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
Read
</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	This is indicated for most unix clients by an <code>R</code>
	in the <code>Status</code> header.
	</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Downloaded
</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	This is indicated for most unix clients by an <code>O</code>
	in the <code>Status</code> header.
	</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Priority
</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	Eudora uses numbers from 1-5 (Highest to Lowest). 
	Kmail responds to a mail header <code>X-Priority</code> with
	these same numbers, but for itself, uses the
	<code>Priority</code> header, which only takes one value,
	<code>urgent</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Pine will "flag" a message with <code>F</code> in the
	<code>X-Status</code> header.
	</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Answered
</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	The conventional means of indicating that one message is a response
	to another is an <code>In-Reply-To</code> header corresponding
	to the <code>Message-ID</code> header of the other.  
	</p>
	<p>
	To use this to determine if a message has been answered, the whole
	mailbox must be read in advance.  Furthermore, this method only 
	works if the responses are in the same mailbox as the original.
	</p>
	<p>
	Later versions of Eudora use this determination when they first
	build the <kbd>.toc</kbd> file for an existing mailbox.
	</p>
	<p>
	Eudora Lite versions 1.x seem not to use or set the
	<code>In-Reply-To</code> header.
	</p>
	<p>
	Kmail seems to make the determination on the fly, and displays 
	responses to messages in a heirarchical fashion.
	</p>
	<p>
	Pine is dumb this way, however, and only indicates the message was
	answered if the header <code>X-Status</code> has the value
	<code>A</code>.
	</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Re-directed, Forwarded
</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	Eudora records and distinguishes between "answered", "forwarded",
	"redirected" messages.  Pine and Kmail only know a message was
	answered.
	</p>
	<p>
	I don't see that Pine or Kmail use this information.
	</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Incoming, Outgoing
</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	These scripts don't address the issue of whether a message is 
	sent by the user or received...it isn't appropriate for them to
	do so.
	</p>
	<p>
	The only way Pine knows whether a message was incoming or outgoing,
	especially with old e-mail that was sent from a different e-mail
	address, is by knowing the user's old e-mail addresses.
	</p>
	<p>
	This makes sense conceptually.  If you're holding a paper missive
	in your hand, and don't remember how it got there, how do you know
	it was outgoing or incoming?  Why, you compare it's addressee to
	your own name (and aliases).
	</p>
	<p>
	To inform Pine of your old e-mail addresses, put them in the list
	<kbd>alt-addresses</kbd> in <kbd>Setup-&gt;Config</kbd>.  Then it
	will display outgoing messages as<br>
		<code>To: &lt;recipient&gt;</code>

	</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>
Special mailboxes
</h2>

<p>
Most clients have special mailboxes for incoming, outgoing, and trash,
and maybe draft messages.  Eudora2Unix does its best to account for those
of Eudora, Pine, and Kmail, according to this table:
</p>
<table id="special-mbx" cellspacing="10">
<tr>
<th>Eudora *</th>	<th>Pine</th>	<th>KMail</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><kbd>In.mbx</kbd></td>	<td><kbd>saved-messages</kbd> **</td>	<td><kbd>inbox</kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><kbd>Out.mbx</kbd></td>	<td><kbd>sent-mail</kbd></td>	<td><kbd>sent-mail</kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><kbd>Trash.mbx</kbd></td>	<td>***</td>	<td><kbd>trash</kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>n/a</td>	<td><kbd>postponed-msgs</kbd></td>	<td><kbd>outbox</kbd> (touched)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>n/a</td>	<td></td>	<td><kbd>drafts</kbd> (skipped)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><td>
*   </td><td>Eudora for the Mac lacks the <kbd>.mbx</kbd> suffix
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
**  </td><td>When used as a POP client, Pine's INBOX is on the server; not a
real file; downloaded messages are in saved-messages
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
*** </td><td>Pine doesn't have a trash mailbox--just marks messages for
deletion.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>
Attachments
</h2>

<p>
Eudora extracts all attachments, converts them, and saves them in a 
user-configurable directory.  In the place of the encoded binary,
it places a line like<br />
<code class="indent">Attachment converted: filepath</code><br />
in the message body.
</p>

<p>
This isn't very useful on the unix side.  Besides ignoring the issue,
there are two alternatives: either re-encode the binaries, and replace
them in their corresponding messages according to RFC 2045, or somehow
replace the Eudora filepath indicator with something more useful on
the unix side.
</p>

<p>
The latter is certainly easier, and it's what I've done.  Eudora2Unix
creates a URI to a file<br />
<code class="indent">file://$HOME/maildir/attach/binary</code><br />
Where attach is the argument of the <code>-a</code> flag passed to
Eudora2Unix,
and should correspond to the name of the Eudora attachments folder.
Note this folder should be re-named to have no spaces.  For Mac
mail directories, Eudora2Unix also avoids processing this folder as
a mail folder (since Mac mailbox names have no extensions, there's no
other way for Eudora2Unix to distinguish between mailboxes and other
binaries).
</p>

<p>
It makes the attachment 'clickable' only in Pine, and only if the
file path contains no spaces.  I have contacted both the Pine and
Kmail developers about this issue.  There is no reason why this
method should not work well.
</p>

<p>
Note that it makes some sense for this directory to be invisible
to Pine, so a name like '<kbd>.attachments</kbd>' is good.
</p>

<h2>
Directory structure
</h2>

<p>
The Eudora Mac mail directory structure is straightforward: the
mailbox display reflects the filesystem structure.
The Windows versions distinguish mail folders with a '<kbd>.fol</kbd>'
suffix and mailbox files with a '<kbd>.mbx</kbd>'suffix.  These
suffixes aren't displayed by the program.  Furthermore, the
Windows 3.x versions must use 8-character DOS file names, but display
nice long folder names.  This is accomplished by means of a small
table named '<kbd>dscmap.pce</kbd>' in each directory that contains
mailboxes.
</p>

<p>
Pine's directory structure is also straightforward.  It starts in
the directory <kbd>$HOME/mail</kbd> by default. Note that a 
directory can be hidden from folder display by putting a '<kbd>.</kbd>'
in front of its name.
</p>

<p>
Kmail's directory structure is unjustifiably complicated.  The folder
names it displays correspond to directories, which must include
subdirectories '<kbd>cur</kbd>' '<kbd>new</kbd>' and '<kbd>tmp</kbd>',
but which <em>do not</em> contain mailboxes! 
The actual content of the folder is in an <em>invisible</em> folder named
'<kbd>.foldername.directory</kbd>'.  Good grief.
</p>

<h2>
Example
</h2>
<p>
Copy Eudora directory to unix directory <kbd>eudora-mail-directory</kbd>,
rename the Eudora Attachments folder as '<kbd>.attachments</kbd>',
</p>

<p>
<code class="indent">Eudora2Unix.py -t kmail -a '.attachments' eudora-mail-directory</code>
</p>

<p>
This will finally produce a directory '<kbd>Mail.e2u</kbd>'.  Once
your are happy with it, and you're sure it won't wipe out anything
important, its contents should be moved to the '<kbd>Mail</kbd>'
directory.  Then Kmail will be able to see the results.
</p>

<h2>
To Do
</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
Attachments
</dt>
<dd>
	Re-encode and insert into mbox?
	Just get Pine and Kmail to view file URI's properly?
</dd>
<dt>
Other unix clients
</dt>
<dd>
	I see the purpose of this software as being to get Eudora
	mail over to unix, not in being a generic unix mail converter.
	It does Pine because I like Pine and Pine mailboxes are very
	like Eudora's; it does Kmail because it was originally written
	to do Kmail and Kmail is very popular.
	However, if another client could be supported by making a
	simple alteration, I wouldn't object.
</dd>
<dt>
Technical
</dt>
<dd>
	Re-write EudoraTOC to make use of Python's built-in endian
	struct unpackers.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The scripts are also documented internally.  User-level documentation
can be viewed with the Python script '<kbd>pydoc.py</kbd>', which comes
with recent Python distributions.
